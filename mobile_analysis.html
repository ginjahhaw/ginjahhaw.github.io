            <!-- ***********************************************
Use the web site you think did the best job of meeting visitor needs during your 24 hour mobile browsing experience.

            <h2>Target.com</h2>
            <p>URL: http://www.target.com </p>
            <section id="analysis">
                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <h3> Demographic</h3>
                <p>I thought that the Target website did a really great job with their mobile site. The target audience is the typical american mom. Any class of income, any education, and anywhere seeing as the website ships to virtually any location. </p>
                <h3> How the site met my needs.</h3>
                <p> The site met the basic needs of the visitor by keeping things really clean simple and organized. They used the repition principle in the way that they kept the navigation bar in the same place no matter what link I clicked on within the site. They also keep up with their brand by using the red elements throughout the site. </p>
                <h3> Organization of the content</h3>
                <p> The content was organized by department, after they had their "Harvest Sale" section right at the top of the page. But a tiny scroll down the page and you can find all the departments in a nice little grid set up. I loved the alignment of that section. There is a simplicity about it that is very pleasing to the eye.</p>
                <h3> Greatest strength of website</h3>
                <p> The best thing target did to make the expirience enjoyable was that there was not a single pop-up on the whole site.I clicked link after link and not a single pop-up which is really nice. I felt as if the webste had a very nice and fast flow to it. If I was going online to get one thing. It would be easy and simple to achieve my goal with little if any interference or re-direction from the site.</p>
                <h3> Facillitaion in the mobile environment</h3>
                <p> I definitely feel that the Target website facillitates to the mobile users very well and very quickly. It is easy to find what you need, it is simple to navigate through the page, and it is nice to look at and browse through.</p>
