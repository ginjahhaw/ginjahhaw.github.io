Use the web site you think did the best job of meeting visitor needs during your 24 hour mobile browsing experience.

                <h2>Target.com</h2>
                <p>URL: http://www.target.com </p>
                <section id="analysis">
                    <h3> How the site met my needs.</h3>
                    <p> The site met the basic needs of the visitor by keeping things really clean simple and organized. They used the repition principle in the way that they kept the navigation bar in the same place no matter what link I clicked on within the site. They also keep up with their brand by using the red elements throughout the site. </p>
                    <h3> Organization of the content</h3>
                    <p> The content was organized by department, after they had their "Harvest Sale" section right at the top of the page. But a tiny scroll down the page and you can find all the departments in a nice little grid set up. I loved the alignment of that section. There is a simplicity about it that is very pleasing to the eye.</p>
                    <h3> Greatest strength of website</h3>
                    <p> The best thing target did to make the expirience enjoyable was that there was not a single pop-up on the whole site.I clicked link after link and not a single pop-up which is really nice. I felt as if the webste had a very nice and fast flow to it. If I was going online to get one thing. It would be easy and simple to achieve my goal with little if any interference or re-direction from the site.</p>
                    <h3> Facillitaion in the mobile environment</h3>
                    <p> I definitely feel that the Target website facillitates to the mobile users very well and very quickly. It is easy to find what you need, it is simple to navigate through the page, and it is nice to look at and browse through.</p>

                    <h2> Site Contrast </h2>
                    <p>The contrast site did not:
                    <ul>Know the target audience</ul>
                    <ul>Meet the needs of their audience</ul>
                    <ul> Organize the content well</ul>
                    <ul>Facillitate visitors in a mobile environment</ul>
                    </p>

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <h4> Demographic</h4>
                <p>I thought that the Target website did a really great job with their mobile site. The target audience is the typical american mom. Any class of income, any education, and anywhere seeing as the website ships to virtually any location. </p> The goals of the site are to make shopping fast convenient, and enjoyable so visitors will stay and browse the site.
                <p>The persona I have developed is that of a middle-aged mom of three teenage girls ranging in ages from 13-18. My mom has received a bachelors degree and has not held a job for long seeing as her husband is the bread-winner. She comes to the site looking for back to school clothes for her daughters. On average my mom spends about three to 5 hours a day browsing her phone. My mom is pretty busy going from one event to the other to support her children. She mostly shops online using her Iphone. She is motivated by the fear of having her daughters bullied at school for not having cute new clothes every year. She is looking for trendy, and moderately priced clothing. </p>
                <p>Quote: I need back to school clothing </p>
                <p></p> This image shows persona by offering a "sale" for moms who may want to get new decorations and or new home supplies.
